This webcast will introduce web development using Sinatra. 
Sinatra is a small domain specific language written in Ruby 
that can be used for creating web applications, 
APIs as well as large-scale database-driven modular sites. 
It is flexible, fast and stable and has a low barrier to entry.

This webcast will cover:
Installing Sinatra Writing a one page web application 
Responding to different HTTP verbs using route handlers 
Capturing parameters Creating a RESTful interface 
Rendering Views Using Helper methods 
Configuration Handling errors Using CSS and JS preprocessors
Connecting to a Database Testing Writing Modular applications 
Using Rack Middleware and Ruby gems to extend Sinatra Deploying the application to Heroku

During the webcast we will be building a simple 
To Do List application to demonstrate some of the principles.
